# Mass-Balance-LCA
This repository contains the code used to calculate mass balances for a concrete production process in Brightway2 (Mutel, 2017). This code supports the analysis published in journal paper, **"[TITLE OF PAPER]" and citation. ** conducted as part of the UNCARB project at the University of Bath (https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/projects/towards-net-zero-carbon-buildings-tackling-uncertainty-when-predi)
The selected unit process is for concrete production, producing 2316 kg (or 1 m3) of concrete, where the mass inputs and their proportions have been based on Miller (2018). The LCA calculation was performed using Brightway2 (Mutel, 2017). 

The .CSV file contains the input database containing the process information. 
The LCA and Balance Calculation jupyter notebook contains the LCA calculation definition, uncertainty analysis and mass balance calculation. The results can be exported to excel.
The Figure jupyter notebook contains the results figures and associated code used in the paper.
